# Computational-Probability-and-Inference-MIT
All the projects I did for the MIT/Edx course "Computational Probability and Inference"

Here's the link to the course (https://www.edx.org/course/computational-probability-inference-mitx-6-008-1x)

I have mixed feelings about this one. I loved the projects -- movie recommendations with Naive Bayes, robot locating (on Mars no less!) with Hidden Markov Models, etc... I really thought they posed interesting challenges and I enjoyed working through them. I also think I walked away from the course with a good toolset to apply elsewhere.

I was less enthused about the quality of the instruction however. I sometimes went to outside sources to learn an important concept when the video lectures weren't cutting it. That said, it was their first time running through the course online so they may get it straightened out in the future. And of course, it's all freely available and I learned a great deal so I'm certainly not complaining.

In any case, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
